## Inspiration

The idea sparked from my experience exploring [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/), a site packed with cryptocurrency data. I wanted to build something of my own, something functional and exciting. So I dove headfirst into React. CoinDeno Web is not only my first React project, but also a deep dive into the world of real-time APIs and full-stack development.

## Challenges

- Integrating with the CoinGecko API to fetch live cryptocurrency data
- Setting up and securing user authentication and data storage
- Managing application-wide state with Redux without losing my mind ðŸ˜…

## Lessons Learned

This project was a crash course in modern web development:

- React + Redux: My first taste of building reactive interfaces with real-time state management.
- Backend & Databases: Learned how to structure user accounts and store transaction data securely.
- Authentication & Security: Built secure login and portfolio storage features.

## The Website

CoinDeno Web is a crypto tracking platform where users can:

- Create an account and manage their own crypto portfolio
- Track coins they care about in real time
- Log wallet addresses and transaction history
- Keep everything organized in one intuitive dashboard

Built with ðŸ’™ using React + Vite for fast and modern web development.
