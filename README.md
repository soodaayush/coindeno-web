## Inspiration

What inspired me to make this app was CoinGecko's website, which contained a database on most cryptocurrencies. This website was my first interaction with React, which allowed me to expand my technical skills.

## Challenges

The challenges faced when creating this app included fetching data from CoinGecko's API, setting up the database behind the accounts, and ensuring it is secure.

## Lessons Learned

Since React was my first web framework, I learned a tremendous amount about React, especially concerning Redux. I learned about creating a database and how the website can interact with it.

## The Website

CoinDeno Web is a website that tracks cryptocurrencies. You can open an account on this website and build your own portfolio, add your favorite cryptocurrencies, log all the transactions you have made, and log your wallets. This website was built using Vite for React.
